def pipe(data, *funcs):
    """ Pipe a value through a sequence of functions

    I.e. ``pipe(data, f, g, h)`` is equivalent to ``h(g(f(data)))``

    We think of the value as progressing through a pipe of several
    transformations, much like pipes in UNIX

    ``$ cat data | f | g | h``

    >>> double = lambda i: 2 * i
    >>> pipe(3, double, str)
    '6'
